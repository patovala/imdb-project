@article{ColumnOriented,
    Abstract = {Conventional row-oriented relational databases have been the natural step in the evolution of databases and they have evolved from the file-based data storage systems. However, with advances in hardware and impressive price to performance ratios the suitability of column-oriented databases have been examined in the context of large datawarehouses and a wide variety of analytical applications. These applications call for different processing requirements. A review of current research has been conducted in order to test the claims made by the developers of column-oriented databases as an alternative paradigm. The results provide ample justification for the use of column-stores instead of traditional roworiented systems for analytical applications and they paint a clear picture of the benefits that analysts can obtain by employing column-stores.
